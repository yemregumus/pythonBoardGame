In this Assignment we learn how to use various Data Structures created in python to develop something. For example in this example we used queue data structure to create a game and further used binary search tree data structure to predict the moves of the game. Hence, in conclusion, we learnt how to integrate our knowledge of creating data structures and analyzing algorithms, to develop a perfect and efficient software.

In this assignemnt I did partA of the assignemnt and helped review and fix some of the bugs. I learned to use various data structures to make the game playable. I had a hard time with fixing the fail test on my part but I learned that we have team mates who can help to fix the issue and that working as a team helps in building a project more faster and efficiently.
